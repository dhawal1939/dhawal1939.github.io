I am Dhawal, a second-year Ph.D. candidate at [Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA](https://home.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth). I am working with Prof. [Adithya Pediredla](https://sites.google.com/view/adithyapediredla/) in developing Novel Imaging Systems. I specifically work with [Acousto\-optic imaging systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40864-z), leveraging their mechanical friction-free capabilities for developing fast imaging techniques. I completed my Masters at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I spent a wonderful time working with Prof. [P.J. Narayanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._Narayanan) and some great folks at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/).
