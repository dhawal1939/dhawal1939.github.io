I am Dhawal, a first-year Ph.D. student at [Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH](https://home.dartmouth.edu/dartmouth). I am working with Prof. [Adithya Pediredla](https://sites.google.com/view/adithyapediredla/) in developing Novel Imaging Systems. I specifically work with Acousto\-optic imaging systems, leveraging their mechanical friction-free capabilities and developing fast imaging techniques. I completed my Masters at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I spent a wonderful time working with Prof. [P.J. Narayanan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3HKjt_IAAAAJ) and some great folks at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/).
